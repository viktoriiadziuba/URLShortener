Creating a JAR File
At first you need to compile your .java files into absolutely different directory from your root. Let's imagine that we have some project called URLShortener. The root directory of this project is UrlShortener/src/com/company. 

Firstly, compile this project by command: javac -d bin src/com/company/*.java
-d bin(name of target directory) - idebtify where your project will be compiled
src/com/company/*.java - identify from where javac should take files to compile

Secondly, create a JAR file by command: jar -cfve URLShortener.jar com.company.Main -C bin/ .
-c --create                 Create the archive
-f, --file=FILE             The archive file name. When omitted, either stdin or
                             stdout is used based on the operation
-v, --verbose               Generate verbose output on standard output
-e, --main-class=CLASSNAME  The application entry point for stand-alone
                             applications bundled into a modular, or executable,
                             jar archive
URLShortener.jar - name of the future JAR
com.company.Main - pass to the main class
-C - To change directories during execution of the command. See below for an example.
bin/ - name if the directory
. - all files from that directory

And the last step: java -jar URLShortener.jar 
This command is cheking if you jar file is working correctly
